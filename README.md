# ML Startup Pack / Create ML Startup App 

Mission: Enable a proliferation of micro sized ML businesses, by minimizing the overhead of going from zero code to user data flowing through production.

Let's help new entrants maximize the advantages of starting from scratch.


Design constraints:
- Customer: The only customer is the stage zero startup founders.

- Product:
  - A template for everything you need to go from zero to live in production, with the minimal amount of headroom needed to grow to seed funding.
  - Zero code used by the customer is maintained by the starter pack.
  - Documentation is a first class citizen. The intent behind every line of code is explained.
  - The customer and product constraints means that the product never needs to accommodate existing users i.e. there is never any need for backwards compatibility between versions. The only sub-version release shall be for bug fixes. 

- Providers:
  - Any given release will support only a single provider for a given feature/requirement.
  - However, providers are free to change between releases, given there is no need for backwards compatibility, by design.
